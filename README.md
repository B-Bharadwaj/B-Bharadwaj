Hi, I'm Bharadwaj

I’m a developer interested in AI/ML, full-stack development, and building practical systems end-to-end.
Most of my work focuses on combining machine learning, NLP, and modern web frameworks to solve real problems.

I enjoy designing systems with clear architecture, clean code, and real-world usability.
