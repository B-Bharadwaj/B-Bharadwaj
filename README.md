# 👋Hi, I'm Bharadwaj

I'm a software engineer focused on **AI/ML, NLP, and full-stack system development**.  
I work on projects that combine **deep learning**, **automation workflows**, and **scalable backend architectures** to create practical and efficient solutions.

I value clean design, strong engineering principles, and end-to-end execution.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 SENN – Self-Evolving Neural Network  
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white)]()  [![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-EE4C2C?logo=pytorch&logoColor=white)]()  [![Deep Learning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deep%20Learning-000000?logo=academia&logoColor=white)]()

A neural architecture search (NAS) system that automatically designs and evolves CNNs using genetic algorithms.

**Highlights:**  
- Automated CNN generation with mutation + selection  
- Built for CIFAR-10 image classification  
- Architecture pruning & performance-based evolution  
- Tracks model fitness across generations  
- Produces lightweight, high-accuracy CNN candidates

### 🔹 Medical Report Simplifier (LLM-Based)  
[![NLP](https://img.shields.io/badge/NLP-4285F4?logo=google&logoColor=white)]()  [![Transformers](https://img.shields.io/badge/Transformers-FF9900?logo=huggingface&logoColor=white)]()  [![AI Safety](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medical%20AI%20Safety-8A2BE2)]()

A controlled medical NLP pipeline that converts complex clinical text into accessible, patient-friendly language.

**Highlights:**  
- Uses Gemini / Llama-based models for domain-adaptive simplification  
- Safety layers: negation detection, ontology cross-checking, terminology preservation  
- End-to-end workflow: PDF → extraction → LLM rewrite → evaluation  
- Readability and semantic similarity scoring  
- Designed for clinical accuracy and trustworthy generation  

**Repo:** *(https://github.com/B-Bharadwaj/Medical-Report-Simplifier)*

### 🔹 Claim Reimbursement System (Full-Stack + OCR)  
[![Django](https://img.shields.io/badge/Django-092E20?logo=django&logoColor=white)]()[![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-61DAFB?logo=react&logoColor=black)]()  [![FastAPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/FastAPI-009688?logo=fastapi&logoColor=white)]()  [![OCR](https://img.shields.io/badge/OCR-EasyOCR-yellow)]()

A scalable reimbursement platform that automates the claim process with OCR-driven data extraction.

**Highlights:**  
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind for clean, responsive UI  
- **Backend:** Django + DRF with secure role-based APIs  
- **OCR Microservice:** FastAPI + EasyOCR for receipt parsing  
- Supports Employee, Manager, and Finance roles  
- Converts receipt images → structured JSON → automated form population  
- Built with modular microservices and enterprise-style workflows
